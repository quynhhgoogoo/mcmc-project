# Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods in Bayesian Machine Learning

## Objective

The goal of this project is to derive, implement and compare different MCMC methods in
Bayesian machine learning tasks such as nonlinear regression with Bayesian neural networks
(BNNs) and time series prediction with BNNs. Such neural networks do not only enjoy the
expressive power of traditional neural networks but also benefit from the advantages of the
Bayesian approach for inference such as flexible uncertainty quantification. The project will also
evaluate both quantitatively and qualitatively how well samples from MCMC chain represent
samples from posterior distribution of interest. The algorithms are also compared by measuring
the resulting models accuracy on validation data
